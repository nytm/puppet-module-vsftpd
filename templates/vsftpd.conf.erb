# which should not be accessible in any way. The affected items are not hidden,
# but any attempt to do anything to them (download, change into directory, affect
# something within directory etc.) will be denied. This option is very simple,
# and should not be used for serious access control - the filesystem's permissions
# should be used in preference. However, this option may be useful in certain virtual
# user setups. In particular aware that if a filename is accessible by a variety
# of names (perhaps due to symbolic links or hard links), then care must be taken
# to deny access to all the names. Access will be denied to items if their name
# contains the string given by hide_file, or if they match the regular expression
# specified by hide_file. Note that vsftpd's regular expression matching code is
# a simple implementation which is a subset of full regular expression functionality.
# Because of this, you will need to carefully and exhaustively test any application
# of this option. And you are recommended to use filesystem permissions for any
# important security policies due to their greater reliability. Supported regex
# syntax is any number of *, ? and unnested {,} operators. Regex matching is only
# supported on the last component of a path, e.g. a/b/? is supported but a/?/c is not.
